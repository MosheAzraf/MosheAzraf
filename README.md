# 💫 About Me:
I'm a Backend & Cloud Developer with hands-on experience across various technologies.  
I bring a broad, hands-on perspective — I like understanding how everything connects, from backend logic to making sure things actually work.

I'm familiar with core AWS services, cloud concepts, CI/CD pipelines, and Linux environments.  
My current tech stack includes .NET, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, MongoDB, and AWS.
